# EZLive: Self-hosted Serverless Livestream

EZLive is a minimal self-hosted livestream solution built on top of S3-compatible object storage.

It runs a local RTMP server, receive live video, turns it into HLS segments (.m3u8 + .ts) and serves them as static files through any S3-compatible OSS. No dedicated streaming server is required â€” everything runs serverlessly. Then you can easily setup a HTML5 HLS player to watch the stream.

# Build

Install dependencies:

- FFMpeg (libavformat, libavutil, libavcodec)
- AWS C++ SDK (libaws-cpp-sdk-core, libaws-cpp-sdk-s3)

Build:

    make


# Usage

Setup a S3-compatible OSS bucket, for example, Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Minio, DigitalOcean, etc.

Then create a config file `config`:

```
listening_addr=127.0.0.1
listening_port=1935
bucket=YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
endpoint=https://your-oss.com
s3_path=ezlive/
access_key=YOUR_S3_ACCESS_KEY
secret_key=YOUR_S3_SECRET_KEY
region=auto
```

In the dashboard of your OSS cloud provider, add the domain name of your web HLS player to CORS setting. If you don't know how to setup a web HLS player, just add `https://mistivia.github.io`.

Start EZLive:

```
./ezlive
```

Open OBS, streaming to `rtmp://127.0.0.1/live`, no streaming key needed. The streaming format must be H.264 + AAC.

Then use a HLS player to load `https://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME.our-oss.com/ezlive/stream.m3u8` to watch the stream.

If you don't know how to setup a HLS player, then make sure you have added `https://mistivia.github.io` in your OSS's CORS setting, then open `https://mistivia.github.io/ezlive#https://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME.our-oss.com/ezlive/stream.m3u8`.

# WARNING

The Docker and Windows binary builds were done on my laptop. While I promise I have no malicious intent, this does not guarantee that my build environment is secure, so is the build target. If you truly care about your privacy and security, please make sure to build from source yourself.

# Docker Usage

Download the docker image tarball in [release](https://github.com/mistivia/ezlive/releases).

Load the docker image:

    cat ezlive-docker-image.tar.gz | gzip -d | sudo docker load

Create a directory `conf`:

    mkdir conf

Create a config file `conf/config`, the config file is nearly the same as the config above. But for docker, the `listening_addr` should be `0.0.0.0`:

    listening_addr=0.0.0.0
    listening_port=1935
    bucket=YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
    endpoint=https://your-oss.com
    s3_path=ezlive/
    access_key=YOUR_S3_ACCESS_KEY
    secret_key=YOUR_S3_SECRET_KEY
    region=auto

Start docker container:

    sudo docker run -it --rm \
        -v ./conf:/etc/ezlive/ \
        -p 127.0.0.1:1935:1935 \
        localhost/ezlive    

# Windows

For windows users, there is a windows build using MSYS2. See [release](https://github.com/mistivia/ezlive/releases).

To start using, unzip the windows tarball, create a `config` file in the same directory as `ezlive.exe`, and run `ezlive.exe`.
